# FlashCards Starter Kit

### Description
Got a big test or interview coming up? Check out the flashcards application! This application can be cloned directly to your local computer and run through the terminal, making it easily accessible when your studies take you outdoors. Utilizing ES6 classes, the application runs through 30 "Cards" and allows the user to guess which answer is correct. The application will then alert the user if they selected the correct solution. Happy studying!
